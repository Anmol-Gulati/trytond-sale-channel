Introduction
============

Welcome to the Sales Channel Module Documentation. The Sales Channel module
introduces a way to segment orders in Tryton based on their source.
Some channel types also have the ability to export stock and catalog
information in addition to being able to import orders from external channels.

The core module introduces minimal functionalities required for orders to be
taken manually from Tryton Sales module for orders placed on offline channels
like emails, phones or by your own sales teams.

The sale channel module also provides a way to set optimal defaults for
creating orders from different channels. Examples of sale channels are

* Your web store
* Showroom 1
* Showroom 2
* Tradeshow 1

If you have different warehouse, pricelists, payment terms or invoicing
methods that change with the channel, you could use this module to make manage
all of these easily.

In addition, the sale channel module is also used by other Tryton modules that
integrate with external channels like eCommerce systems (shopify, magento) and
marketplaces (amazon, ebay).

In this module, we will learn about creating new sales channel and adding
records to them.

This documentation assumes that you have the module installed and working in
your Tryton database.
